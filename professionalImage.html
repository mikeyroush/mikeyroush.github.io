        <p>
          I did not know I was interested in the field of Computer Science/ Engineering until late
          into my high school career, but I have been in love with it ever since. Computer Science
          is such a vast field; there are endless applications and use cases for it. Because of
          this, I have been able to use computer science to contribute at least one thing to every
          work experience I have been a part of. With Code Ninjas, I built a database to house our
          records. With Arbin Instruments, I wrote software to automate our calibration process.

          At Code Ninjas, we stored all of our records about our students on paper. It was hard to
          keep our records organized and led to inefficiency and waste. I saw the problem and
          immediately knew that a database would be the perfect solution. So, I used Microsoft
          Access to build a relational database with SQL and macros. Now, not only could we track
          students' progress, like before, but we could also run queries and compile reports to
          determine which students were excelling and which students were falling behind. My boss is
          happy with the increased productivity, and the parents are happy with our increased level
          of communication and clarity regarding their children's progress.

          At Arbin Instruments, we had to manually calibrate our PWM's and other similar devices,
          which could take hours for just one device. So, I, along with one other intern, was
          assigned the task of automating the entire process. We used Visual Basics to design our
          GUI for our application, along with C# and python to do all of the behind the scenes work.
          My main contributions to the project were taking care of GPIB communication and linear
          regression. We used GPIB communication to pull values from our multimeters, then fed those
          values into my linear regression software to calculate the best slope and intercept for
          calibration.
