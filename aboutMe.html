          I am a computer engineering major at Texas A&M University. I aspire to use the skills I
          have learned in my degree to become the CIO of a company one day. In fifteen years, I hope
          to have several real estate investments that generate a passive income. But, beyond a
          successful career and monetary gain, I want to be a good son, father, mentor, and friend.

          Oprah Winfrey once said, "Do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do,
          "and I fully buy into this mentality. However, I also believe a good work/ life balance is
          essential to a happy life. For that reason, I have several hobbies and interests. Some of
          these include the

          Mountain biking, and biking in general, are quite possibly my favorite hobbies out of the
          list. I have gotten several bumps, scrapes, and bruises from mountain biking, but I cannot
          think of a better analogy for life. When you get knocked down, you have to get right back
          up. I enjoy biking even more when I am doing it for a cause. The MS 150 is a grueling
          150-mile bike ride from Houston to Austin for charity. Whatever you do, do it to the best
          of your ability.
