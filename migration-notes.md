# Astro Migration Notes

## About GitHub Pages Deployment
- The GitHub free plan includes GitHub Actions with 2,000 minutes per month for private repositories and unlimited minutes for public repositories.
- The current deployment workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is configured correctly:
  - It builds the site using `npm run build`
  - It deploys the `dist/` directory to GitHub Pages
  - No need to commit the `dist/` directory (it's correctly in `.gitignore`)

## Files to Remove
The following files/directories are no longer needed after migration:
- `gulpfile.js` - Gulp build system is replaced by Astro
- `css/` directory - CSS is now handled by Tailwind and Astro
- `js/` directory - JavaScript is now in the Astro components
- `scss/` directory - Styling is now handled by Tailwind
- `index.html` - Root HTML is now generated by Astro
- Temporary migration files (`migration-plan.md`, etc.)

## Migration Workflow
1. Run the local development server to ensure everything is working:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Build the site locally:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

4. Clean up old files:
   ```bash
   ./cleanup.sh
   ```

5. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete migration to Astro"
   git push
   ```

6. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy the site.

## Important Preserved Files
- `CNAME` - Copied to `public/` directory to maintain custom domain
- `documents/` - Copied to `public/documents/` to preserve existing files
- `images/` - Copied to `public/images/` to maintain asset references

## New Project Structure
```

```

The GitHub Actions workflow will handle building and deploying the site, so there's no need to commit the `dist/` directory.
