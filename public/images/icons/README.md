# Custom Theme Icons

This directory contains custom icons for the theme toggle feature.

## Custom Theme Icons

To customize the theme icons:

1. Place your custom PNG images in this directory
2. Name them `coffee.png` and `bourbon.png` respectively 
3. Images should have transparent backgrounds for best results
4. Recommended size: 24px × 24px (will be displayed at 20px × 20px)

The ThemeToggle component has been configured to use these images automatically.

## Current Icons
- `coffee.png` - Used for the Coffee theme (light mode)
- `bourbon.png` - Used for the Bourbon theme (dark mode)
