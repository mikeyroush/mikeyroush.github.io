        <p>
          I consider my greatest act of service to be the work that I do at Code Ninjas. At Code
          Ninjas, we teach young children how to code and build robots and circuits, but more
          importantly, we provide a safe and welcoming environment for our ninjas (students) to
          learn. We encourage our ninjas to collaborate and have fun, while we build the coders of
          tomorrow. Computer science is an ever-growing field, and we believe that kids cannot start
          learning the basics soon enough. Coding is the language of the twenty-first century, and
          our ninjas are building the foundation they need to use that language to build something
          truly great. I cannot wait to see the things that they will accomplish.
