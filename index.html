          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFPmyCTlxQw&frags=pl%2Cwn" target="_blank">[video]</a>. I believe it
          is easy to maintain the status quo. However, I desire to differentiate
          myself from the majority, so I created this website to give you some insight as to who I
          am and what my goals and interests include.

        <p>
          I am a computer engineering major at Texas A&M University. I aspire to use the skills I
          have learned in my degree to become the CIO of a company one day. In fifteen years, I
          hope to have several real estate investments that generate a passive income. But, beyond
          a successful career and monetary gain, I want to be a good son, father, mentor, and
          friend.

          Oprah Winfrey once said, "Do what you have to do until you can do what you want to do,
          "and I fully buy into this mentality. However, I also believe a good work/ life balance
          is essential to a happy life. For that reason, I have several hobbies and interests.
          Some of these include the
          <a href="https://secure.nationalmssociety.org/site/TR?fr_id=30201&pg=entry" target="_blank">MS 150</a>,
          mountain biking, football, waterskiing, traveling, and hiking.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Mountain biking, and biking in general, are quite possibly my favorite hobbies out of
          the list. I have gotten several bumps, scrapes, and bruises from mountain biking, but I
          cannot think of a better analogy for life. When you get knocked down, you have to get
          right back up. I enjoy biking even more when I am doing it for a cause. The MS 150 is a
          grueling 150-mile bike ride from Houston to Austin for charity. Whatever you do, do it
          to the best of your ability.

          I consider my greatest act of service to be the work that I do at Code Ninjas. At Code
          Ninjas, we teach young children how to code and build robots and circuits, but more
          importantly, we provide a safe and welcoming environment for our ninjas (students) to
          learn. We encourage our ninjas to collaborate and have fun, while we build the coders of
          tomorrow. Computer science is an ever-growing field, and we believe that kids cannot
          start learning the basics soon enough. Coding is the language of the twenty-first
          century, and our ninjas are building the foundation they need to use that language to
          build something truly great. I cannot wait to see the things that they will accomplish.

        <p>
          I did not know I was interested in the field of Computer Science/ Engineering until late
          into my high school career, but I have been in love with it ever since. Computer Science
          is such a vast field; there are endless applications and use cases for it. Because of
          this, I have been able to use computer science to contribute at least one thing to every
          work experience I have been a part of. With Code Ninjas, I built a database to house our
          records. With Arbin Instruments, I wrote software to automate our calibration process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At Code Ninjas, we stored all of our records about our students on paper. It was hard to
          keep our records organized and led to inefficiency and waste. I saw the problem and
          immediately knew that a database would be the perfect solution. So, I used Microsoft
          Access to build a relational database with SQL and macros. Now, not only could we track
          students' progress, like before, but we could also run queries and compile reports to
          determine which students were excelling and which students were falling behind. My boss
          is happy with the increased productivity, and the parents are happy with our increased
          level of communication and clarity regarding their children's progress.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At Arbin Instruments, we had to manually calibrate our PWM's and other similar devices,
          which could take hours for just one device. So, I, along with one other intern, was
          assigned the task of automating the entire process. We used Visual Basics to design our
          GUI for our application, along with C# and python to do all of the behind the scenes
          work. My main contributions to the project were taking care of GPIB communication and
          linear regression. We used GPIB communication to pull values from our multimeters, then
          fed those values into my linear regression software to calculate the best slope and
          intercept for calibration.
